        /// I quickly realised that I was not going anywhere with just that. ðŸ˜…
        ///
        /// I figure that the best path forward would be to use `AVAssetWritter` and start adding the texture byte data. This would be probably
        /// done in `draw(in: MTKView)` so that we could do it every frame, recording a watermark video frame by frame. AssetWriter would then give us, at a
        /// given url, the watermarking video only. However I wonder, how much time would we have to wait for the video to record? The same amount of time that
        /// the original video has?
        ///
        /// Then it would be probably the time for `AVComposition` to shine, and we would have to mix the original video track with the watermark video track with the
        /// audio track.
        ///
        /// The simpler approach would be to just record the `UIView` where all of this happens, however the original video size can be quite larger than whatever
        /// is rendered in a given `UIView`.
        ///
        /// No easy way out other than simply exporting the video in its original form, with the trimmed start and end. Maybe one day I'll do it. ðŸ‘€
