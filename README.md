# Trimark
A simple enough application that just trims one video!

### What does it do?
- Trims one video.
- Displays a watermarking using Metal driven rendering.
- Adjustable playback window by draggable trimming controls.
- Seeking controls on the thumbnail previews.
- Export and share videos that were trimmed!
- _A lot of attention to interactions to avoid weird scenarios_

### Show me some pictures!

### I'm not convinced, do you have a video?
